## Session History

### Session 1 - 2026-01-09 (Initialization)
**Worked on:** Complete project initialization and scaffold

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created main project directory structure
- ✅ Initialized Laravel 11 backend with PHP 8.3
- ✅ Initialized React + Vite + TypeScript frontend
- ✅ Configured Tailwind CSS with custom woodworking theme colors:
  - Wood shades (50-900)
  - Sawdust (light, default, dark)
  - Coffee (light, default, dark)
- ✅ Created docker-compose.yml with MySQL 8.0 and phpMyAdmin
- ✅ Configured Laravel .env with database credentials
- ✅ Configured Laravel .env.example with Stripe placeholder keys
- ✅ Generated comprehensive FEATURES.md with all project features as checklist
- ✅ Created detailed README.md with:
  - Project overview
  - Tech stack documentation
  - Installation instructions
  - API endpoints reference
  - Development workflow
  - Deployment guide
  - Code standards
- ✅ Initialized git repository
- ✅ Made initial commit (ad5f1a6)
- ✅ Created this progress tracking file

**Commits:**
- ad5f1a6 - Initial project setup

**Notes for next agent:**
1. **First priority:** Install and configure Laravel Sanctum for SPA authentication
   - Run: `composer require laravel/sanctum`
   - Publish config: `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Sanctum\SanctumServiceProvider"`
   - Configure CORS in `config/cors.php`
   - Update `config/sanctum.php` for SPA authentication
   - Add Sanctum middleware to `bootstrap/app.php`

2. **Second priority:** Start Docker containers and verify MySQL connection
   - Run: `docker-compose up -d`
   - Verify: `docker-compose ps`
   - Test connection from Laravel

3. **Third priority:** Begin Phase 1.2 - Database Schema
   - Create migrations for all tables (see FEATURES.md Phase 1.2)
   - Start with core tables: users, products, product_images, categories
   - Create model files with relationships
   - Create factory and seeder files

4. **Additional setup needed:**
   - Install Stripe PHP SDK: `composer require stripe/stripe-php`
   - Install frontend dependencies:
     - `npm install react-router-dom axios @tanstack/react-query`
     - `npm install -D @types/react-router-dom`
   - Configure API routes file: `backend/routes/api.php`
   - Set up CORS for localhost:5173 (Vite dev server)

5. **Testing setup:**
   - Backend: PHPUnit is already configured
   - Frontend: Install testing libraries when ready for tests

6. **Architecture decisions made:**
   - Using Tailwind CSS exclusively for styling (no CSS modules or styled-components)
   - Using React Query for API state management (to be installed)
   - Using Laravel Sanctum for SPA auth (simpler than Passport for this use case)
   - Using Stripe Checkout Sessions (simpler than Elements for initial launch)
   - Using local file storage initially (can migrate to S3 later)

7. **Important reminders:**
   - Never commit .env file (only .env.example)
   - Always run tests before committing
   - Update FEATURES.md checkboxes as features are completed
   - Keep this progress file updated after each session
   - Make atomic commits with clear messages

8. **Potential blockers to watch for:**
   - Stripe webhook testing requires Stripe CLI or ngrok for local development
   - Image uploads will need proper Laravel storage configuration
   - CORS configuration must allow credentials for Sanctum cookies

## Next Steps (Recommended Order)

1. Install Laravel Sanctum and configure SPA authentication
2. Start Docker MySQL container and verify connection
3. Create database migrations for core tables
4. Create Eloquent models with relationships
5. Create database seeders (especially for admin user)
6. Install Stripe PHP SDK
7. Install frontend packages (react-router-dom, axios, react-query)
8. Create basic API structure (routes, controllers)
9. Set up frontend routing structure
10. Build authentication flow (login page + API)
