**Commits:**
- 7b6120d - feat(backend): create Eloquent models and database seeders

**Notes for next agent:**
1. **First priority:** Start Docker and run migrations/seeders
   - User needs to run: `docker-compose up -d` (Docker not available in this environment)
   - Run: `cd backend && php artisan migrate`
   - Run: `php artisan db:seed`
   - Verify admin user was created: admin@sawdustandcoffee.com / password
   - Verify categories and site content were seeded

2. **Second priority:** Build authentication system (Phase 1.3)
   - Create AuthController with login/logout/user methods
   - Implement login logic with Sanctum
   - Create AuthService for business logic
   - Create login page in React
   - Set up React Context for auth state
   - Create protected route component

5. **Architecture decisions made:**
   - Using Tailwind CSS exclusively for styling (no CSS modules or styled-components)
   - Using React Query for API state management (installed)
   - Using Laravel Sanctum for SPA auth (configured)
   - Using Stripe Checkout Sessions (SDK installed)
   - Using local file storage initially (can migrate to S3 later)
   - Product-Category is many-to-many relationship (pivot table created)
   - Order items store product/variant snapshot at purchase time

6. **Important reminders:**
   - Docker must be started by user: `docker-compose up -d`
   - Never commit .env file (only .env.example)
   - Always run tests before committing
   - Update FEATURES.md checkboxes as features are completed
   - Keep this progress file updated after each session
   - Make atomic commits with clear messages

7. **Potential blockers to watch for:**
   - MySQL must be running before migrations can run
   - Stripe webhook testing requires Stripe CLI or ngrok for local development
   - Image uploads will need proper Laravel storage configuration
   - CORS is configured but needs testing with actual frontend requests

## Next Steps (Recommended Order)

1. Start Docker MySQL container (user action required: `docker-compose up -d`)
2. Run migrations and seeders (`php artisan migrate && php artisan db:seed`)
3. Create authentication API endpoints (AuthController with login/logout/user)
4. Create login page in React
5. Set up React Router and auth context
6. Test authentication flow end-to-end
7. Create admin dashboard layout
8. Build product CRUD API endpoints
9. Build product management UI
10. Build gallery management features

  - Resource routes for products, categories, gallery, orders, quotes, content
- ✅ Created complete frontend authentication system:

  - Logout clears session properly
